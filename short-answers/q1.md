# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
Async/await does a better job handling errors around async code and makes it easier to debug code because it uses try/catch code blocks around the actual code. It's easier because it allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code and avoids nested structures can lead to "callback hell".


# Teacher Feedback

This is true but why is it easier? Why is it more readable? What gets removed when we use async/await?
