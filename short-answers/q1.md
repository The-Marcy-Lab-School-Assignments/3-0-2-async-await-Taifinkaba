# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
Async/await does a better job handling errors around async code and makes it easier to debug code because it uses try/catch code blocks around the actual code.
